Business logic description
--

  We can create commitment to any given customer ID, by providing
target amount value and given discount percentage.

  Each commitment has a valid date interval, currently the current
calendar year. E.g. creating a commitment as YYYY-03-14 has a valid
date interval till YYYY-12-31 23:59:59.

  Target or discount percentage cannot be updated, neither the
commitment can be removed. To update the commitment details, we need
to create a new commitment to the given customer ID. This will
WITHDRAW the current commitment, by setting its status to withdrawn;
creating a new commitment with the given new details, and copying
the current balance and its purchase_log into the new one.

  So commitment in a calendar year is a kind of continuous.

  Commitment balance is calculated by the added or removed purchase
details. Purchase can be added only to an active commitment; but
purchase can be removed from a withdrawn commitment; and this action
will remove it from all of its successors as well.

  Removing a purchase from a commitment means logical removal. The
given purchase info will be presented under the related commitments,
but with a removed status flag.

  Each commitment has a calculated status: is active. This status
is true, when the commitment is not withdrawn and its date interval
is valid. Otherwise its not active, and cannot be used.

  Valid discount percentages:

  0%
  1%
  2%
  3%
  4%
  5%
  6%

  Other values will cause an error return.
